# Virtex
## Easy Pose Recognition

Virtex is an easy to use wrapper for pose estimation which lets you not only estimate the pose but classify the poses.
You can train on images having those poses or you can also train for poses in real time using the webcam. The classifier
implements XG Boost Classifier by default but can be changed to your own classification model.
